# Projects-CS50-1-Knights
CS50 1st Project : Knights

I have included the facts about the given world for each knowledge base.
Then I have included implications as per what characters say, ie.
if what each character say is true he is a knight, and if not he is a knave.

The knowledge is enough to conclude who is a knight and who is a knvae.

Thank you.
